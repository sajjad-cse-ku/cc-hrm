# Database Fix Commands

## Issue Fixed
The error occurred because the new `username` field was added to the users table but existing seeders weren't updated to include it.

## Solution Applied
✅ Updated `DatabaseSeeder.php` to include username and other required fields
✅ Updated `AdminDataSeeder.php` to generate usernames and new fields  
✅ Updated `UserFactory.php` to include all new fields

## Commands to Fix Your Database

Run these commands in order:

```bash
# 1. Drop all tables and start fresh
php artisan migrate:fresh

# 2. Run the seeders (this will now work without errors)
php artisan db:seed

# Alternative: If you want to run just the user seeders
php artisan db:seed --class=UserTableSeeder
```

## What's Now Fixed

### DatabaseSeeder.php
- Added `username`, `phone_number`, `status`, `role` to the test user

### AdminDataSeeder.php  
- Generates unique usernames from names (e.g., "john.doe123")
- Adds random phone numbers (70% chance)
- Assigns random status and roles
- Creates 200 diverse users for testing

### UserFactory.php
- Updated to include all new fields
- Generates realistic usernames
- Can be used with `User::factory(10)->create()`

### UserTableSeeder.php
- Creates 10 specific users matching your reference design
- Ready-to-use sample data

## Verification

After running the commands, you can verify everything works:

```bash
# Check if users were created properly
php artisan tinker
>>> App\Models\User::count()
>>> App\Models\User::first()
```

Your user management table should now work perfectly with all the sample data!
